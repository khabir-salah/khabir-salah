Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

Survey and Feedback Application(https://github.com/khabir-salah/SurveyFeedback-MVC):  A web application developed with ASP.NET Core MVC that allows users to log in, create survey questions, and send them as links to other users for feedback. Users can log back into the application to view feedback responses and analyze survey results.
Survey Service(https://github.com/khabir-salah/SurveyandFeedback-UsingAdo.net): An console application using Ado .NET Framework that enables users to log in and create surveys. Each survey requires admin approval before becoming accessible to other users for feedback. Logged-in users can check the status of their survey questions to see if they have been approved or denied by the admin. Admins have the ability to view all users of the application but do not have access to the survey feedback.
Shortlet Booking Manager(https://github.com/khabir-salah/BookingManager):  An application developed with the MVC framework that allows users to search for shortlets, book a shortlet, and make payments. This application streamlines the process of finding and securing short-term rentals, providing a seamless user experience from search to payment.
